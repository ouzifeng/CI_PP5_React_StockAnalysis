### Use Case

A Swiss based family office has contracted me to build an investment analysis platform so them to analyse dividend paying stocks for their yield bearing investment portfolio, with a strong focus on European companies. There are tools out there that cover the companies they want to look at,but one of the biggest challenges they face is building a shortlist of companies they want to understand better in the first place.

To this end, the platform needs to focus on 3 areas:

1. A stock screener that allows the filtering on stock based on yield bearing criteria, namely yield size, payout ratio and price to earnings ratio
2. Individual stock pages where a breakdown of the companies fundamental performance can be tracked
3. An investment note taking feature. As users perform the necessary financial due diligence, it is important that they can take notes of their findings, and be able to edit and delete them. They must be easily accessible as they are often copied and shared in memos internally

The project is split into a react based backend which can be found [here](https://github.com/ouzifeng/CI_PP5_API). This depository is dedicated to the frontend, which has been built using React JS

### Site Structure

In an attempt to follow React best design practices, the site has been broken down into three main sections:

1. **Base Layout**
   - **Location**: `src/layouts/BaseLayout.js`
   - **Description**: This is the foundational layout upon which all other pages are built. It includes common elements such as the header, footer, and navigation menu, providing a consistent structure across the application.

2. **Pages**
   - **Location**: `src/pages/`
   - **Description**: These are the main views of the application, layered on top of the base layout. Each page represents a specific route and functionality within the app. Key pages include:
     - `ContactUs.js`: The contact information and form for user inquiries.
     - `DividendScreener.js`: A tool for users to screen and filter dividend stocks.
     - `EmailVerified.js`: The confirmation page displayed after a user verifies their email address.
     - `Following.js`: A page showing the stocks the user is following.
     - `ForgotPassword.js`: The password recovery page for users who have forgotten their password.
     - `Login.js`: The login page for user authentication.
     - `ResetPassword.js`: The page for resetting the userâ€™s password.
     - `SignUp.js`: The registration page for new users.
     - `StockDetailPage.js`: The detailed view of an individual stock, including metrics, notes, and historical data.

3. **Components**
   - **Location**: `src/components/`
   - **Description**: Reusable UI elements and functionalities that are used across various pages and layouts. This directory is further organized into subdirectories for better manageability. Key components include:

     - **Common Components (`src/components/common/`)**:
       - **Footer.js**: 
         - **Description**: The footer component that appears at the bottom of each page. It includes links to various sections of the site and other relevant information.
         - **Usage**: Included in the `BaseLayout.js` to ensure it appears on all pages.
       - **Header.jsx**: 
         - **Description**: The header component that appears at the top of each page. It contains the logo, navigation links, and user account options.
         - **Usage**: Included in the `BaseLayout.js` to ensure it appears on all pages.
       - **MenuDrawer.js**: 
         - **Description**: A sidebar menu component that provides navigation links in a collapsible drawer format.
         - **Usage**: Used in the `Header.jsx` to provide additional navigation options for mobile and tablet users.

     - **Context (`src/context/`)**:
       - **AuthContext.js**: 
         - **Description**: Provides a context for managing authentication state across the application. It includes methods for logging in, logging out, and checking the current user's authentication status.
         - **Usage**: Wrapped around the main application component to provide authentication state to all components.

     - **Routes (`src/components/`)**:
       - **ProtectedRoute.js**: 
         - **Description**: A higher-order component (HOC) that restricts access to certain routes. It checks if the user is authenticated before rendering the route's component; otherwise, it redirects to the login page.
         - **Usage**: Used to protect pages that require user authentication, such as the `StockDetailPage.js`.
       - **RestrictedRoute.js**: 
         - **Description**: Similar to `ProtectedRoute.js`, but used to restrict routes for authenticated users only. It renders a different component or redirects based on the user's authentication status.
         - **Usage**: Used for routes like `Login.js` and `SignUp.js` to prevent authenticated users from accessing them.

     - **Utility Components**:
       - **useDebounce.js**: 
         - **Description**: A custom hook that debounces a given value. Useful for optimizing performance by limiting the rate at which a function is executed, such as search input handlers.
         - **Usage**: Used in components that require debounced input handling, like search bars.

       - **MessageAndRedirect.js**: 
         - **Description**: A component that displays a message to the user and redirects them after a certain period.
         - **Usage**: Used for actions that require user feedback and subsequent redirection, such as after a successful form submission.

4. **Assets**
   - **Location**: `src/assets/`
   - **Description**: Static files such as images and stylesheets. This directory is organized to include:
     - `images/`: All image files used in the application.
     - `styles/`: Custom CSS files like `custom.css` for styling the application.

5. **Utilities**
   - **Location**: `src/utils/`
   - **Description**: Utility functions and helpers that are used across the application for various purposes.

6. **Services**
   - **Location**: `src/services/`
   - **Description**: Modules for handling API calls and interactions with backend services.

### Development Practices

- **Environment Configuration**
  - **Location**: `.env.local`
  - **Description**: Configuration file for environment variables, ensuring sensitive data like API keys are not hardcoded.

- **Global Styles**
  - **Location**: `App.css`
  - **Description**: Contains global CSS styles that apply to the entire application.
